My version of the reddit website, created as part of the curriculum of The Odin Project using React and Firebase Firestore.

After a year, still a WIP

I really just wanted to burn through this project to continue on my studies which is why the styling is pretty lacking.

Part of my portfolio to show my ability to work with APIs, handle page navigation and users, and interacting with a basic NoSQL database a form security.

[Redrit](https://redrit-75871.web.app/)

View posts created by yourself and other users, saved to Firebase.

updates to add:

-Set up link in profile to users posts and comments

-In the future would create more collections for votes where each post would have
its own collection for upvotes in addition to the comments, so they would be easier
to query, rather than just having one large collection of all votes.
For profile list, could just have reference to the post/comment they made, do not need full copy of the object.
